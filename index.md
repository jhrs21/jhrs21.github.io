# About me

I'm an Engineering Manager passionate about the intersection of technology, data, and leadership. With a decade of experience building and scaling data solutions, I now focus on empowering teams to innovate and deliver impactful results. I believe in fostering collaborative environments where continuous learning and technical excellence are paramount.

My journey began in Venezuela, where I earned a Computer Science degree from Universidad Simón Bolívar. I gained valuable experience working with various startups, ranging from small, agile teams to larger, more established organizations. This diverse experience instilled in me a strong understanding of different work environments and the importance of adaptability and problem-solving.

In 2014, I moved to Barcelona to pursue a Master's degree in Data Science at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), further deepening my expertise in this field.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm an avid craft beer enthusiast, enjoy staying active through sports, and have recently taken up running.

I'm a strong believer in the power of the tech community. I actively collaborate with organizations like Software Crafters BCN, Python BCN, and Lidr.co (tech leadership), as well as other tech initiatives. I believe that these communities are invaluable for sharing knowledge, staying at the forefront of technological advancements, and fostering a supportive and collaborative environment for engineers. I regularly attend tech conferences to expand my knowledge and connect with other professionals in the field.
